The British developed Kolkata into a major center of trade and commerce. It played a crucial role in the British Empire's administration and economy, serving as a hub for the East India Company's activities.

    <h2 id="delhi"> History Of Delhi</h2>
    <p> 
        <pre>
            
The history of Delhi, often referred to as Dilli in Hindi, is long and illustrious, with the city serving as a significant political, cultural, and economic center for centuries. Here's a brief overview: 
<b><span class="early">Period:</span></b>The area around Delhi has been inhabited since ancient times, with archaeological evidence suggesting human settlements dating back to the 6th century BCE. The region was part of various ancient Indian kingdoms and empires, including the Maurya Empire and the Gupta Empire.
<b><span class="early">Islamic Rule:</span></b>Delhi rose to prominence as a major political and cultural center under Islamic rule. The Delhi Sultanate was established in the 13th century when the Turkic ruler Qutb-ud-din Aibak founded the Slave Dynasty. Subsequent dynasties, such as the Khilji, Tughlaq, and Lodi dynasties, ruled Delhi until the arrival of the Mughals.
<b><span class="early">Mughal Era:</span></b>The Mughal Empire, one of the most significant in Indian history, established its capital in Delhi during the early 16th century. Under Mughal rule, Delhi became a center of art, architecture, and commerce. The Mughal emperors, including Babur, Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, constructed magnificent buildings like the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and Humayun's Tomb, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites today.
<b><span class="early">Colonial Period:</span></b>In the 17th century, Delhi faced invasions from Persian and Afghan rulers such as Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah Durrani, resulting in the decline of Mughal power. In 1803, the British East India Company defeated the Marathas and captured Delhi. The city became a part of British India, although the Mughal Emperors continued to reside in the Red Fort as figureheads.
<b><span class="early">Indian Independence Movement:</span></b>Delhi played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. It was the site of several important events and movements, including the 1857 Indian Rebellion (often referred to as the Sepoy Mutiny) and Mahatma Gandhi's campaigns of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance.
<b><span class="early">Post-Independence Era:</span></b>After India gained independence in 1947, Delhi became the capital of the newly independent nation. It was declared a Union Territory in 1956 and later designated as the National Capital Territory of Delhi in 1992. Over the years, Delhi has grown rapidly, both in terms of population and infrastructure, becoming a major political, cultural, and economic center in modern India.

<b><span class="today">Today, Delhi is a bustling metropolis, known for its historic monuments, vibrant culture, diverse population, and political significance as the capital of India.</b></span>
